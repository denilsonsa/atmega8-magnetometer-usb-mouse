"Why does the compiler compile an 8-bit operation that uses bitwise operators into a 16-bit operation in assembly?"
	However, in my experiment, nothing has changed. I guess GCC was smart
	enough to use 8-bit operations here.


How to setup TWI bit rate generator:
	TWBR = 7
	TWPS = 0
	==> 400kHz @ CPU clock of 12MHz

Unnamed unions and structs:
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1972003/how-to-use-anonymous-structs-unions-in-c
	http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Unnamed-Fields.html
	from "man gcc" (version 4.4.5):
	       -fms-extensions
           Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header files.

           Some cases of unnamed fields in structures and unions are only accepted
           with this option.
	Anonymous structures and unions are part of C1X standard: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C1X

HID Report Constraints:
	Each top level collection must be an application collection and reports may not
	span more than one top level collection.
	Page 57/67 of HID1_11.pdf

Reducing the firmware size:
	If the firmware size is slightly above the limit, you can save quite a few
	bytes easily by shortening the strings from menu.c (at least 200 bytes can
	be saved this way).

	Also depending on the compiler options, it is possible to inline the
	TWI_Transceiver_Busy() function (it's just a simple expression anyway).
	But maybe the compiler has already inlined it for you.

	In addition, each character from USB_CFG_VENDOR_NAME and
	USB_CFG_DEVICE_NAME takes up 2 bytes because is stored in an array of
	integers. Reducing the vendor/device names might further shrink the
	firmware size a little bit.
